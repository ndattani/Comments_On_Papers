"An arbitrary 2-local Hamiltonian can be made to have coefficients that are integral multiples of
 Î± by dividing them all by their greatest common divisor and multiplying by  Delta_a."

What about  pi*x1x2 + e*x1x3 ?
We can make the first coefficient an integer by dividing by pi.
Then we have x1x2 + e*x1x3, and we cannot make the 2nd coefficient an integer without messing up the first coefficient again.

"We assume without loss of generality that the coefficients of the PUBO to be reduced are integers
and structure the reductions so that the reduced QUBO also has integral coefficients."

Have you not lost generality, because you can't do pi*x1x2 + e*x1x3 ?

Also, do we really need (1 + |alpha_ijk|) everywhere instead of just Lambda > 0?
